To complete this assessment these are the points I added:

I added one interface called Bee and three different class(Worker, Queen, Drone) that implements Bee interface.

One another class will have a static list to contain 10 instances of all types of Bee.

While clicking on the Damage link, based on the class object it will call the damage methodfor example 
if you have clicked on Worker type record it will call damage method of the worker class.

If health status is dead it won't further reduce health percentage.
